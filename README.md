# GuessingGamePart1

Included are my guessinggame-1 html, css, and images files. My biggest frustration was my inability to center things as I wanted them, I think I need to just keep practicing. 

Although it is rather plain, I spent more hours on this...than any other project thus far. I am extremely unfamiliar with webdesign from scratch and look forward to learning more.
